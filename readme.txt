Modify Project-Specific Information

Update Project Name:

Replace any occurrences of the project name (project-1) with a generic placeholder name or a token that you can easily replace when creating a new project. This might include:
File and folder names.
References in code files (e.g., import statements, comments).
Package.json (name field).
Update Package Name:

Similarly, update the package name in the package.json file to a placeholder or token that you can replace when creating a new project.
Customize Configuration Files:

Tailwind CSS: If you have any custom Tailwind CSS configurations specific to project-1, you might want to replace them with generic configurations or remove them altogether.
Vite: If you have any custom Vite configurations specific to project-1, update them as needed.
Clean Up Unused Assets:

Remove any project-specific assets (images, icons, etc.) that are not required for the template project.
Modify README and Documentation:

Update the README file and any documentation to provide generic instructions and information that apply to any project created from the template.
Customize Gitignore:

Modify the .gitignore file to include or exclude any project-specific files or directories that should or should not be included in the template.
Adjust Environment Variables:

If your project relies on environment variables, ensure that any default or sample environment variables provided in the template are generic and can be customized for each new project.
Review and Test:

Before saving the template, review all changes to ensure that project-specific information has been appropriately replaced or generalized.
Test the template project to ensure that it works as expected and that all modifications have been applied correctly.
